# orgmode_neon_on_black

This is neon on black color scheme I created to compliment my standard neon color scheme which did not have support for the orgmode package.

## Basic info
I currently use, and love MattDMo's Neon Color Scheme, found here at GitHub: [https://github.com/MattDMo/Neon-color-scheme](https://github.com/MattDMo/Neon-color-scheme)

The orgmode package can be found here: [https://github.com/danielmagnussons/orgmode](https://github.com/danielmagnussons/orgmode)

## The setup
Download or copy the file and place it in the appropriate folder
- On Windows: `C:\Users\yourUserName\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\Packages\orgmode\Color Scheme`
- MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3`
- Linux: `~/.config/sublime-text-3`

Sublime text allows you, under Preferences, to select `Settings - Syntax Specific`. Do this while having a `.org` file selected.

Then in the right hand side under user prefereces add `"color_scheme": "Packages/orgmode/Color Scheme/orgmode_neon_on_black.tmTheme"` to the JSON. This will set this theme as the color theme for only `.org` files.

## Additional Info
I build this at a point I was giving the orgmode thing a test drive. I have become very attached to my current color scheme, and when I found it wasn't supporting orgmode I was sad. :-(

I submitted an issue to the developer of orgmode about possibly submitting the color scheme to him, but he appears to have abandoned or stopped working on the project the project. Additionally Neon-color-scheme's developer left a note on the repo that he currently does not have time to support his open source projects. So... here we are.

This is really a variation of the previously mentioned Neon-color-scheme, though I toned the main text down just a tad. This helped me visually seperate my coding work from org mode.

I really have not used orgmode very much since I started this. I am certain there are somethings I would eventually change and/or improve, if I give it another go around, but for now...
